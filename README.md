- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tirso0882.


- 👀 I’m interested in Generative AI, computer vision, and distributed system. With experience in developing ETL pipelines, working with LLMs for document analysis, and building real-time object recognition systems, I'm always exploring new ways to integrate AI into data-driven solutions.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data engineering techniques and pursuing a Data Engineer Professional certification to enhance my skills in managing large-scale data projects. Additionally, I'm delving into the world of AI agents to understand their potential in automating and optimizing data processes and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for innovative applications.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve integrating AI technologies into data pipelines, creating advanced computer vision models for object detection and tracking, exploring the potential of generative AI in various industries, and creating intelligent AI agents that can automate complex tasks.
